# 🤖 Chapter 4: Agent-Driven Development — Mastering GitHub Copilot Chat

In modern development, the tools you use to write code are as critical as the code itself.
For a complex, full-stack application like **The AI-Powered Recruiter**, we need **speed**, **accuracy**, and **security**.

This chapter explains how to **leverage GitHub Copilot’s Agent (Chat) Mode** effectively — a mode far superior to inline completions for generating **multi-step functions** required in our **RAG architecture**.

---

## 🚀 4.1 Why Agent Mode is Ideal for Our RAG Stack

While inline completions are useful for small suggestions, **Agent Mode** is designed for **complex, multi-context tasks**, making it perfect for our system.

### ✅ Advantages

* **🧩 Orchestrating Complex Logic**
  RAG functions (e.g., PDF parsing, chunking, embedding) require multiple sequential steps and libraries.
  The Agent can generate the entire flow cohesively in one structured response.

* **🔗 Bridging Backend & Frontend**
  When switching between **Node.js** and **React Native**, you can explicitly guide the Agent —
  e.g., *“I’m now working on the Expo frontend”* — preventing framework confusion.

* **⚡ Advanced Model Access**
  GitHub Copilot Chat often runs on more powerful **LLMs (e.g., GPT-4)**, providing superior reasoning, debugging, and context understanding for complex logic.

## 🧠 4.2 The Core Principle — The Prompt is Your Blueprint

In Agent mode, the **prompt is everything**.
You’re not giving hints; you’re providing a **complete blueprint** for the code you expect.

### 📊 Agent Prompting vs. Inline Prompting

| **Prompt Style**           | **Goal**                                              | **Ideal Use Case**                                                           |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Inline (Comments)**      | Short, immediate completions                          | Writing loops, variable declarations, or simple JSX                          |
| **Agent (Conversational)** | Generate complete, multi-step functions or full files | Writing the `vectorSearch` function or building a responsive React component |

> 🧩 For our purposes — building the **RAG backend (Node.js)** and **Expo components** — we rely primarily on **detailed Agent Prompts**.

## 🧰 4.3 Mastering the Prompt — Practical Prompts for Our Stack

To get the best results from the Copilot Agent, every prompt must include:

* 🎯 **Goal** — What the code should do
* 💻 **Technology** — The target environment or framework
* 🔁 **Input/Output** — Expected parameters and return values
* 🔒 **Security Constraints** — Any performance or data safety requirements

---

### 🧮 **Agent Prompt 1: RAG Backend Logic**

**Goal:**

> “Write a Node.js function named `vectorSearch`.”

**Input/Output:**

> “It must accept two arguments: `queryVector` (float array) and `jobId` (string), and return an array of the top 10 relevant candidate records.”

**Technology:**

> “Use the `node-pg` library for PostgreSQL. Perform vector search using the `pgvector` extension and the `<->` operator on the `candidate_vectors` table, filtering by `jobId`.”

**Security/Performance:**

> “Order results by similarity and select only `app_id` and `text_chunk`.”

---

### 📱 **Agent Prompt 2: Expo Frontend Component**

**Goal:**

> “Write a React Native functional component named `ResumeUploadForm`.”

**Technology:**

> “Use `expo-document-picker` to select a single PDF file, and `useState` to manage the selected file URI.”

**Styling:**

> “Apply **Tailwind CSS** classes. Create a large, rounded button with `bg-indigo-600` and display the selected file name.”

**Action:**

> “Include a stub `handleSubmit()` function that will later upload the file to the Node.js API.”

## 🧩 4.4 General Beginner Advice

* ✅ **Verify Everything**
  Copilot is an *assistant*, not an *authority*. Always review generated code for logic or security issues.

* 🔍 **Know Your Error**
  If something is wrong — delete it. Rewrite the prompt more specifically instead of debugging flawed AI code.

* 🧱 **Start Small**
  Build foundational pieces manually (like the DB connection in Chapter 5), then use them as context for the Agent to write complex RAG logic (Chapter 6).

## 🔒 4.5 Security & Privacy — Hiding Secrets from Copilot Agent

A key professional skill is **preventing AI tools from accessing sensitive keys or credentials**.
Your API keys can leak through context if not isolated properly.

---

### 🛡️ The Two-Step Security Protocol

1. **Store Secrets in `.env`**
   Never hardcode keys or passwords in source files.
   Store them in a `.env` file at your project root:

   ```bash
   LLM_API_KEY=your_secret_key_here
   DATABASE_URL=postgres://user:password@host:port/dbname
   ```

   Access them via:

   ```js
   process.env.LLM_API_KEY
   ```

2. **Exclude `.env` via `.gitignore`**
   Add `.env` to your `.gitignore` to ensure neither Git nor Copilot Agent can read it.

   ```bash
   # Source control exclusion
   .env

   # Node.js defaults
   node_modules/
   dist/
   build/
   ```

By excluding `.env`, you ensure the Copilot Agent can see **how** your app uses the variable —
but never the **actual secret value**.

---

## ✅ Summary

* 💡 Use **Agent Mode** for orchestrating multi-step logic and cross-stack development.
* 🧭 Write **detailed prompts** that specify goal, tech, input/output, and security.
* 🧱 Keep your `.env` and sensitive data protected from version control and AI context.

This disciplined, **agent-driven development workflow** allows you to move fast, maintain clarity, and ensure security across your full-stack AI system.
