Short answer: overlapping chunks (a sliding window) mean you deliberately repeat a small portion of text from one chunk into the next so that you don’t accidentally split important context across chunk boundaries. It increases recall for semantic search and prevents losing relationships (e.g., a job title and its bullets) that span the cut.

Why it matters
- Natural text doesn’t line up with fixed chunk sizes. A sentence, bullet list, or job entry can be split at the boundary, losing the semantic unit the LLM needs to judge relevance.
- Similarity search is done per chunk. If a query matches text that was split across two chunks, each half may be weaker on its own and rank lower.
- Overlap gives the LLM contiguous context so it can make better judgments and produce less fragmented, less hallucination-prone results.

How it works (concept)
- Choose a chunk size C and an overlap size O (both expressed as words or tokens).
- Create chunks:
  - chunk1 = text[0 : C)
  - chunk2 = text[C - O : C - O + C)
  - chunk3 = text[2*(C - O) : 2*(C - O) + C)
  - …continue until end of document
- This is a sliding window: each chunk starts O units before the previous chunk ended.

Practical guidelines (what to pick)
- Use token-based sizing where possible (more consistent across languages and LLM models). If tokens are hard, use words.
- Typical ranges for document corpora:
  - Chunk size: 200–500 words (or ~500–1,500 tokens depending on LLM/context)
  - Overlap: 10–30% of the chunk (e.g., 20–100 words or 50–200 tokens)
- For resumes (short documents) you can use smaller chunks (150–300 words) and overlap 20–50 words.
- If you have long technical docs, choose larger chunk sizes and larger overlaps.

Tradeoffs
- Pros:
  - Higher recall: relevant fragments aren’t lost by a cut.
  - Better LLM reasoning: contiguous context preserved.
- Cons:
  - More chunks stored => more vectors in DB => slightly higher storage & index cost.
  - Slightly more duplication when retrieved, so instruct the LLM to deduplicate/merge overlapping chunks.

Tips to get the most benefit
- Prefer token-based chunking for production (use the same tokenizer as the LLM).
- Preserve semantic boundaries where you can: split on headings, bullets, or section markers first, then apply windowing within long sections.
- Use a sentence splitter (or paragraph splitter) and try not to cut in the middle of a sentence when possible.
- If you detect a section title (e.g., "Work Experience"), start a chunk at that boundary to keep the section intact.
- When storing metadata with chunks, include offsets (start/end token or character positions) so you can reconstruct or merge overlapping chunks later.
- On retrieval: if multiple chunks overlap, either:
  - Merge them before sending to the LLM, or
  - Tell the LLM to treat overlapping chunks as a single context and avoid duplicating the same facts in its output.

Short Node.js example (word-based fallback)
```javascript
// Simple word-based sliding window chunker
function chunkText(text, chunkSize = 250, overlap = 50) {
  const words = text.split(/\s+/);
  const step = chunkSize - overlap;
  const chunks = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i += step) {
    const chunkWords = words.slice(i, i + chunkSize);
    if (chunkWords.length === 0) break;
    const chunkText = chunkWords.join(' ');
    chunks.push({
      id: `${i}`,               // or generate unique id
      startWord: i,
      endWord: i + chunkWords.length - 1,
      text: chunkText
    });
  }
  return chunks;
}
```
Notes:
- Use a real tokenizer (tiktoken, Hugging Face tokenizers) in production so chunk sizes align with model tokens, not words.
- If you switch embedding models later, re-embed the corpus.

Prompting the LLM for deduplication
- When you pass retrieved chunks to the LLM, add an instruction such as:
  - “Some retrieved chunks may overlap. Merge overlapping content and avoid repeating the same sentences in your output. Cite the earliest chunk id for each fact.”
- You can also pre-merge overlapping chunks on the server by checking offsets and concatenating overlapping texts (dedupe identical substrings).

Example visualization (words)
- chunkSize = 200, overlap = 50
  - chunk1 words 0–199
  - chunk2 words 150–349
  - chunk3 words 300–499
This guarantees that words 150–199 appear in both chunk1 and chunk2, so a multi-sentence idea that starts at word 170 will appear wholly in chunk2.

When to reduce or remove overlap
- If storage or query cost is critical and documents are short or already sectioned, keep overlap minimal.
- If you use a two-stage retrieval (coarse + fine) where a fast coarse retriever gets candidate docs, and then a finer retriever re-chunks, you can tune overlap per stage to reduce cost.

Summary
- Overlap (sliding window) is a small repetition of text between adjacent chunks to preserve semantic units and improve recall.
- Use token-aware chunking, pick reasonable chunk/overlap sizes, preserve section boundaries where possible, store offsets/metadata, and either merge overlapping chunks before sending to the LLM or instruct the LLM to deduplicate.
